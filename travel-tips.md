# Travel Tips -- [Steve Schmidt](https://steve.czmyt.com)

Some personal tips to ease your travel prep so you are always ready for adventure.<br />
Some initial thoughts on how I prepare for travel, with more specifics to follow.

- ### Don't pack before you travel.
    - The simplest, most sophisticated, and lowest stress method of travel prep involves always being mostly packed and ready to go!
        Do this if you can afford it.
        You will always know where to find an essential item even when you're not traveling.
        Pack clothes for longer overnight trips at the last minute.
- ### Repack after travel.
    - Unpack clothes after you travel.
        Replenish any toiletries or expendables that you used during the trip.
        Keep everything else packed and ready for the next trip.
- ### Have a daypack.
    - This might be a backpack, a messenger bag, or a large purse.
        I prefer a backpack because it keeps my hands free.
        I like ones with a sternum strap so it doesn't slip off.
        This should have everything you need for a day trip.
        Consider using an organizer so that you can quickly move your key travel items between different backpacks.
        It should have extra room for items that you do not usually carry.
        Consider using a waterproof backpack or having a raincover if you will be where it might rain.
- ### Have an overnight pack.
    - This might be a larger backpack or a rolling travel bag.
        This is what you will carry with you when you fly.
        I prefer a backpack because it's easier to maneuver with.
        Your daypack or its contents can fit in your overnight pack.
        It includes everything you will need during your initial journey.
        Use bags or packing cubes to keep different kinds of items together.
        Including basic toiletries and a single change of clothes.
- ### Have a large bag.
    - Usually a larger piece of luggage for air travel or a large duffel bag for road trips.
        Mainly for clothes and toiletries for longer trips.
        Includes any items you will need at your destination that cannot be carried in an airplane cabin.
- ### Outerwear and layering.
    - Prefer jackets with hoods, for protection from rain, wind, and cold.
    - Have a lightweight inner layer, preferably with pockets.
        This lightweight inner layer can be worn as a shirt when necessary.
    - Have a down or fiberfill warmth layer for cold protection.
    - Have a lightweight 20K/20K shell outer layer for rain and wind protection.
        A 20K/20K shell will protect you from heavy rain without trapping body moisture.
        Consider getting a shell in the next size up so that it will fit while you are wearing your daypack.
- ### Have a change of clothes.
    - Carry this change of clothes in your overnight pack.
        Consider using items that can be worn by themselves or as layers during colder weather.
        Include underwear and socks.
        Consider lightweight jogging pants that can be worn by themselves or under your regular pants for added warmth.
        Consider a lightweight long-sleeve top that can be worn by itself or over your regular shirt for added warmth.
- ### Think multi use.
    - Consider bringing clothing and gear that has more than one use.
        Like the lightweight jogging pants that can double as undergarments for added warmth.
        Like the universal USB power adapter that can power your laptop and charge your phone.
- ### Test your gear.
    - Test any new gear that you add to your travel packs.
        Make sure that the new USB power adapter works with your laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.
        Make sure everything you bring works with everything you plan to use it with.
- ### Have backups.
    - Bring more than one of anything important.
        Things like earbuds, USB power adapters, charging cords, etc.
- ### Take notes during your trip.
    - Keep track of items you needed but did not have.
        Keep track of toiletries and expendable items that you used and need to replace after your trip.
- ### Use checklists.
    - Make a checklist of key items you will need for travel but do not have packed.
        Things like shirts, pants, socks, underwear, wallet, watch, keys, etc.
    - Make a checklist of things you need to do before leaving.
        Things like check all windows shut, enable house alarm, notify friends / family, etc.
    - Make a checklist of things to do when arriving at and leaving your vacation home.
        Things like turn on the water, light the water heater pilot, etc.
- ### Evolve your system.
    - Regularly upgrade your travel gear.
        Keep the best gear in your travel packs until you have received and tested any new gear.
