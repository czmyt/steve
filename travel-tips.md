Some personal tips to ease your travel prep so you are always ready for adventure.

- ### Don't pack before you travel.
    - The simplest, most sophisticated, and lowest stress method of travel prep involves always being mostly packed and ready to go!
        Do this if you can afford it.
        You will always know where to find an essential item even when you're not traveling.
        Pack clothes for longer overnight trips at the last minute.
- ### Repack after travel.
    - Unpack clothes after you travel.
        Replenish any toiletries or expendables that you used during the trip.
        Keep everything else packed and ready for the next trip.
- ### Have a daypack.
    - This might be a backpack, a messenger bag, or a large purse.
        I prefer a backpack because it keeps my hands free.
        I like ones with a sternum strap so it doesn't slip off.
        This should have everything you need for a day trip.
        It should have extra room for items that you do not usually carry.
- ### Have an overnight pack.
    - This might be a larger backpack or a rolling travel bag.
        This is what you will carry with you when you fly.
        I prefer a backpack because it's easier to maneuver with.
        Your daypack or its contents can fit in your overnight pack.
        It includes everything you will need during your initial journey.
        Including basic toiletries and a single change of clothes.
- ### Have a large bag.
    - Usually a larger piece of luggage for air travel or a large duffel bag for road trips.
        Mainly for clothes and toiletries for longer trips.
        Includes any items you will need at your destination that cannot be carried in an airplane cabin.
