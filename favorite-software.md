### For Every Windows Workstation Computer

I install and configure these apps on every Windows workstation computer that I setup for my personal and small business use.

- [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/): My main Web browser. Setup its sync feature to sync bookmarks, passwords, etc. between computers.
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html): A must-have websites that misbehave in Firefox.
- [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/): Web browsing as anonymous as it gets.
- [Microsoft Office](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/): Mandatory for most small business users.
- [PortableApps](https://portableapps.com/): 500+ high-quality free apps to download and run from USB stick, hard disk / solid-state drive, etc.
