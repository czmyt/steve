    "A memoir and self-help manual by one of the country's [the UK] most treasured comedians - for anyone who feels stuck in a rut but doesn't have the tools or self-belief to shake things up"

    "This illustrated narrative is a collaboration between a gifted Brazilian artist and a New York Times bestselling British historian. Marina Amaral has created two hundred stunning images, using rare photographs as the basis for her full-color digital renditions."

    *Marina's amazing colorizations steal the show.*

    by Gabrielle Stone:

    "What does a woman do when her life has fallen apart and her heart has been ripped out and stepped on twice in two months? She goes on a wild adventure, makes some bad decisions, and does a sh*t load of soul searching."

    *A very interesting story of her solo trip to Europe and her journey to forget, find herself, something.*


- [**Hothouse Earth**: An Inhabitant’s Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Hothouse-Earth-Inhabitants-Bill-McGuire/dp/1785789201)
    by Bill McGuire:

    "provides a … perspective on the climate emergency, acknowledging that it is now practically impossible to keep this side of the 1.5°C dangerous climate change guardrail.  … we can no longer dodge the arrival of disastrous, all-pervasive, climate breakdown that will come as a hammer blow to global society and economy."

    *Assume the worst, prepare for worse, as relates to climate change / disaster / collapse.*

    "Christina shares their distinctive approach to raising confident, security-conscious, resilient children, giving practical takeaways rooted in CIA tradecraft along the way."

    *Especially appreciate the chapter on writing / how to write.*


- [**On Tyranny**: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century](https://www.amazon.com/Tyranny-Twenty-Lessons-Twentieth-Century/dp/0804190119)
    by Timothy Snyder:

    "The Founding Fathers tried to protect us from the threat they knew, the tyranny that overcame ancient democracy. Today, our political order faces new threats, not unlike the totalitarianism of the twentieth century. We are no wiser than the Europeans who saw democracy yield to fascism, Nazism, or communism. Our one advantage is that we might learn from their experience."

    *Most important book of the 21st century.  This version is great.  Expended audio versio better.  Graphic novel version very hard to follow.*


- [**On Tyranny (Expanded Audio Edition)**: Updated with Twenty New Lessons from Russia's War on Ukraine](https://www.amazon.com/Tyranny-Expanded-Audio-Updated-Lessons/dp/B09VMR31RT)
    by Timothy Snyder:

    "In this exclusive audiobook edition, which includes eight hours of new content, Snyder combines the original essays from On Tyranny with twenty new lessons that answer the questions everyone is asking about this [Russo-Ukrainian] war."

    *Recommend this longer audio-only version over the original short book.*
