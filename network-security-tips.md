Note: These tips were written specifically for a client that 1) does not have a private WiFi network in their office, and 2) does provide secure guest WiFi access for visitors.
I hope to generalize this post in the future.
Until then, hopefully you’ll find some good advice below.

## Don’t connect any personal computers or devices to the office network.
- There is a guest WiFi network you can use to connect any personal laptop computers and devices to the Internet.
- Or use your cellphone data service if you have an unlimited data plan.

## Don’t allow visitors to connect their computers to the office network via cable.
- Let them know about the guest WiFi access we provide. Ask a technology staff member for more info about this.

## Don’t connect your work laptop computer to WiFi at the office.
- We don’t provide a secure WiFi network. Chances are you would be connecting to an insecure network controlled by someone who might be evil.
- Use a cable network connection instead while at the office. It’s much faster and more reliable anyway.
- Avoid using WiFi anywhere except at your home or a trusted business. Make sure you connect to the right WiFi network that’s provided by the trusted business!
