Advice for using laptop and desktop computers.

## Don’t use your work computer for personal Web browsing.
- Use your personal cellphone or tablet instead.
- Use your work computer for business purposes only.
- Don’t let anyone else use your computer for work or pleasure.

## Don’t install software on your work computer unless you really need it for work.
- It’s okay to install software from trusted business partners.
- Ask your technology staff before installing anything else.
- It’s okay to allow installed software to update itself.
- Install software updates as soon as you’re notified they’re available. Especially Java updates, Adobe Acrobat / Reader updates and Web browser updates.

## Don’t allow outsiders to access your work computer.
- … not without explicit approval received directly from a technology staff member at your company.
- Don’t let people convince you that they have the approval of your technology staff. Always confirm it directly with a technology staff member.
- Don’t let them convince you to download and install programs onto your computer or to change any settings on it.
- Beware of technical support scams in which people pretend that your computer has technical problems that they want to help you solve. These can come over the phone, via email, or from pop-up windows in Web browsers.
- Consider having internal technology staff available when receiving outside technical support. Even well-meaning, legitimate support can undo a lot of good work by your internal technology staff.

## Don’t connect things to your work computer.
- … things like USB flash drives, unless they came from a trusted business partner.
- Be careful with discs, CDs and DVDs. Only insert ones that came from trusted sources.
- Don’t use the USB connectors on your work computer to charge your personal devices.
- Disconnect microphones from desktop computers when the mic is not in use.
- Cover your laptop camera and microphone with electrical tape or duck tape if you don’t use them very often.

## If your computer acts strangely, contact your technology staff.
- Like if you see pop-up warning messages or ads, or your computer is really slow, or your programs don’t respond as you expect them to.
- Computer strangeness can be a sign of nasty viruses or misbehaving programs.
- Contact a technology staff member if you use your home computer for work and it starts acting strangely.

## Lock your screen when you’re away from your desk.
- … when you go to meetings, the bathroom, to lunch and home.
- Don’t rely on the screen saver to lock your screen for you.
- Hold the Windows flag key and press the letter L to immediately lock your Windows computer.

## Leave your work computer powered on overnight.
- Most automatic software updates and Windows support tasks will run overnight if your computer’s on.

## Limit your use of personal devices and home computers for work purposes.
- Don’t store work passwords and documents on your personal devices and home computers.
- Know that deleting documents doesn’t make them go away!
- We can’t manage your personal stuff like we do your work stuff, so please only use your personal devices for work in ways that we approve.
- If you use a home computer for work purposes, tell a technology staff member if it starts acting strangely.

## Some personal advice: Back up anything you don’t want to lose!
- Your technology staff has good backups of your work computer.
- Ask them how to back up and protect your personal devices and home computers.
- If you don’t back it up, assume it’s going to be lost! It will be sooner or later.
