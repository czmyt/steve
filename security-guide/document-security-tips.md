Advice for securing paper documents and computer files.

### Don’t let that paper trail lead to problems.

## Don’t leave sensitive documents out when away from your desk.
- … especially when you leave for the day.
- Lock them in your desk.

## Dispose of sensitive documents and discs in the shredder bin.
- … never in the wastebasket.
- Assume that someone evil will go through the garbage.

## Don’t include sensitive info in filenames, email subject lines, or on the outside of envelopes.
- Put that sensitive info on the inside of the document or envelope.
- Filenames are frequently not encrypted even when the file contents are.

## Encrypt storage devices used to exchange large amounts of info.
- If you use USB flash drives, memory cards, hard drives or discs to exchange large amounts of info, make sure that the device itself or the files on it are encrypted. Ask your technology staff or an expert how to do this.
- Do not trust the delivery service to handle the device securely, even when using delivery methods with added security. Assume that the device can be lost, stolen, intercepted, or misdirected in transit.

## Wipe unused storage devices as soon as possible.
- If you use a USB flash drive or memory card to store or transfer documents, wipe the device as soon as it’s no longer needed.
- Use at least a complete format to wipe it; never a “quick” format.

## Asset Security
- Don’t take work stuff out of the office. Unless it’s a laptop computer or device that’s assigned to you.
- Keep your cellphone on your person. Don’t be in the habit of laying it down wherever you are.
