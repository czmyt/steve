Advice for physical security in an office environment.

### Keep yourself and the office safe!

## Don’t leave your laptop computer out when the office is unattended.
- Take it with you, or ask a technology staff member to lock it in the computer room if you need to leave it overnight.
- Or lock it in your desk, or hide it out of sight in a pinch.
- Don’t leave it visible in your unattended car. Covering it with a jacket counts as leaving it visible!

## Be watchful of visitors.
- Don’t leave them unattended in people’s offices.
- Have them wait in the reception area or conference room.

## Lock all the office doors after hours.
- Don’t risk having someone come into the office if you’re working late alone.
- Lock all the office doors whenever there is major police activity in the area.

## Be extra careful when entering or leaving the office after hours.
- Keep your key-chain in hand so your safety items are available.
    - See the [Emergency Situation Tips](emergency-situation-tips.md) section for a list of tools you should consider carrying.
- Keep space between yourself and other people you don’t know.
- Avoid unlighted, out-of-sight and isolated areas.
- Lock your car doors as soon as you enter your car.
- The standard call for help in this case is “Help, police!”

## Never touch unattended packages outside the office.
- Get far away from them.
- Warn others to stay away.
- Contact building security or the police.
