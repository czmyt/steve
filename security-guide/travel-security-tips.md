Advice for staying secure while traveling.

### Have a safe trip!

## Take extra security precautions while traveling.
- Shutdown your laptop computer or place it in hibernation mode while in transit so it has the added protection of the BitLocker drive encryption software. Do the same when your laptop is left unattended in your hotel room or car trunk. Never place it in sleep mode or leave it on.
- Enable the Secure Start-up feature on your Android tablets and smartphones. Power off your Android tablet when you won’t be using it or when it’s left unattended.
- Transport computers, tablets, storage drives and other technology devices in carry-on luggage only, never in checked luggage. Remove technology devices from carry-on luggage you’re required to check at the gate and carry the devices with your person.
- Keep your carry-on bags in sight at all times when transiting airports, train stations, etc. Consider using Bluetooth location tags for your carry-on luggage.
- Don’t specifically identify the company you work for while traveling. Be generic when talking about work. Pretend you’re traveling on vacation or personal business.
- Have an ID tag with name, cellphone number and email address on all luggage and technology devices, possibly including a “Reward if Found!” notice. Use your personal email address on luggage tags. Use your personal or business email address on devices, depending on who owns the device.

## Be extra careful when traveling overseas or when dealing with foreign companies.
- Be aware that foreign governments can record the conversations in their airliners, hotel rooms, restaurants, businesses and public spaces.
    - They can intercept cellphone conversations and WiFi signals. They can record documents fed into hotel paper shredders. They can tamper with devices left unattended in hotel rooms and cars. They can enlist the cooperation of their businesses and citizens.
- You get the idea. Assume the worst. Be extra cautious when working overseas.
- Minimize your exposure by bringing only the devices you really need.
    - Seriously consider leaving your laptop computer at home when traveling overseas.
- Memorize important passwords and never carry a written list.
- Carry a printed list of U.S. embassy and consulate telephone numbers for the countries in which you will be traveling. Contact them if you need help overseas.
- Consider changing key passwords after returning home from foreign trips.

## Employ additional security when crossing borders and checkpoints.

- Consider using longer passwords instead of short numeric PINs to lock your cellphone and tablet when you are about to cross a border or enter a security checkpoint.
    - Do not use biometric IDs like fingerprints or facial recognition to secure your device.
    - Wipe your screen thoroughly to obliterate any recently typed passwords.
- Your belongings are subject to search when crossing the United States border or traveling in the U.S. within 100 miles of the border.
    - US Government officials cannot require you to give them your memorized passwords without a court order. Even then, you might not remember your passwords.
- Know the rules where you’ll be traveling.
