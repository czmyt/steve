## Background

The blog posts that refer to this page were originally part of a security guide I wrote for a small business client.
It included security tips and rules for staff members at work and tips for securing personal devices, among other things.

## Might Not Apply to You!

The tips and advice might not apply to your organization or you personally.
I expect to expand and update these tips now that they live as blog posts here at Substack.

## The Original Introduction

“Everyone has a vital role to play in the security of the company and the continued existence of all our jobs.
The stakes are that high.
With this in mind, here’s a list of things you can do to help improve security and safety in our workplace.

“This is a general guide for all staff members.
It’s not meant to cover topics in the Security Program guide that mostly apply to technology staff members.
