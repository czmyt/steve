For cellphones and tables.

Note: These tips were written for a client that requires corporate management of personally-owned cellphones and tablets that are used for business purposes, specifically email.
I hope to generalize this post in the future.
Until then, hopefully you’ll find some good advice below.

## If you use your cellphone or tablet for work email, let us know if it gets lost or stolen.
- The sooner the better!
- We can remotely wipe it. This protects your work email and all of your personal info too.
- Most of your personal info should magically come back when you setup your replacement device. However, this is NOT a substitute for backing up and personal info or photos you have on your device.

## Install an antivirus security app on your cellphone and tablet.
- Do this for your work devices and your personal devices.
- Norton Mobile Security is one of the best free apps.

## Be careful what you install.
- Only install what you really need and use.
- Opt for trusted apps from major brands and avoid companies you’ve never heard of.
- There are a lot of rogue apps that will steal your personal info. It’s not easy to know the good from the bad.

## Wipe your devices before disposing of them.
- When you upgrade your smartphone or tablet, make sure to wipe the old one with at least a factory reset before turning it in or passing it on.
- If your old personal device won’t be reused, physically destroy it.
