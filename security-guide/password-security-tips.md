Advice for choosing and using passwords.

<h3>Passwords are the keys to the kingdom...<br />
Choose them carefully and guard them wisely!</h3>

## Some critical passwords require the strongest protection.
- Passwords such as these:
  - Your Windows login password.
  - The BitLocker password used to startup your computer.
  - Your email account password.
  - Financial services website passwords and PINs.
  - The startup and lock screen PINs for your cellphone and tablet.
- Memorize these few critical passwords!
- Any of these passwords can be changed if you have forgotten them.
- Don’t let your Web browser save any of these critical passwords.
- Only write them down if you can store them in a safe!
  - Never store the purpose of these passwords with the passwords themselves.

## Other passwords can be handled differently.
- You can allow your Web browser to save less important passwords.
- It’s also okay to record them in documents stored on your computer.
  - Use a separate text file or Word document to store each password. For example:
    - File named:
      <br />
      `2022-03-25 Substack.com Password.txt`
    - File contents:
      ```text
      Website: czmyt.substack.com
      Username: czmyt
      Email: steve@czmyt.com
      Password: 4R6h!S(%xk
      Security Q&A: First pet? furlong seattle
      ```
- Don’t store them within email messages.
- It’s not worth recording some less important passwords because they can be changed easily if your Web browser forgets them.

## Choose good passwords!
- For critical passwords:
	- Choose four random words: pick them from a dictionary or thesaurus, not things that you see around you.
	- If the system has special rules, use the four random words plus the same number, symbol and pattern of capitalization.
	- Never use your birth-year, names of family members, or anything that relates to the company or you personally.
- For less important passwords:
	- Choose 10 random characters: open a blank text file or Word document, don’t look directly at your keyboard, then type 10 random characters, some while holding down the shift key.
	- Copy and paste that new random password into the Web browser password field.

## Don’t reuse passwords!

- Never use the same password or PIN more than once for anything.
- Never use a simple variation of a previous password.

If one account gets hacked, your other accounts should remain safe.

## Treat password recovery questions and answers as if they themselves are passwords.

- Never use the same security answer more than once for anything. They’re subject to being hacked just like passwords.
- Never use real info for security answers and especially not publicly-available info.
- Write down your security questions and answers in case you need them to recover forgotten passwords.

## Don’t share passwords with your coworkers.

- If we need your password, the request will come directly from a technology staff member or senior management.
- You should change your password when we tell you we’re finished needing it.
- Don’t share passwords with outside technology support unless it’s okayed directly by internal technology staff or senior management.
- Make sure to change any passwords that were shared with outside technology support when their help is over.

## Don’t let people see you type your passwords.

- Consider not using your work laptop computer in public places.
- Use your smartphone or tablet instead if you can.
- If you have to type passwords in a public place, drape your jacket over your head and computer to make a cone of privacy. It’s geeky but effective.
- Be careful of people peering in through windows to watch you type.

## Change your password if someone finds it out.

- Change it as soon as you can get to a private place.
- Contact a technology staff member if you can't change it quickly.

## Change temporary passwords.

- When you receive temporary passwords, change them immediately.
- Contact a technology staff member if you have problems with password changes.
	- Don’t give up and continue using temporary passwords.

## Don’t send passwords via email.

- ... nor via cellphone text message.
- Avoid mentioning them over the phone when possible.
- When exchanging any passwords with authorized staff members, whisper to them in person, or use a secure smartphone app like Signal Private Messenger (for Android) or Signal (for iPhone).

## Don’t use password manager programs or services to store your passwords.

- Many of these password managers have an online component that has been hacked in the past. And they will be hacked again in the future!
- If you allow your Web browser to remember passwords, never sign into the website associated with your Web browser.
	- For example, if you use Google Chrome, DO NOT sign in to Chrome using your Google account because that will send all your passwords to Google!
