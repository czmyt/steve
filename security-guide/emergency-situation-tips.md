- Know where the fire extinguisher and first aid kit are located in the office.
- Know all escape paths from everywhere in the office.
- Have the cellphone numbers of your boss and their boss saved in your phone. Also store the cellphone numbers of people who report to you.
- Keep important safety items on your key-chain: mini flashlight, whistle, pepper spray, knife and/or something to gouge with.
