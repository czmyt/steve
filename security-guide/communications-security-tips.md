Advice for electronic communications (other than via email).

Note: These tips were written for a client with specific corporate communications policies.
I hope to generalize this post in the future.
Until then, hopefully you’ll find some good advice below.

### Keep the conversation in the family.

## Don’t use instant messaging / chat programs or websites.
- We can’t use these for business purposes because we need to keep a record of all correspondence.
- We also can’t guarantee they’re secure enough.
- Use email instead.
- Only use messaging / chat websites and apps approved by the company, but not for sensitive info or communicating with clients.

## Don’t use smartphone or tablet apps for business communications.
- … unless they’re approved for use by the company.
- Again, we need to have a record of everything and we can’t with these apps.
- Most apps aren’t very secure.
- Use email.
- Unless it’s a password you’re exchanging with another staff member, then you can use a secure messaging app like Signal Private Messenger (for Android) or Signal (for iPhone).

## Don’t use your personal email account for business communications.
- Same reasons.
- Unless you need to email someone at work that you’re going to be out sick. That’s okay.

## Be skeptical of phone calls you receive.
- … especially if you do not know the person and recognize their voice.
- If you have any doubt, tell them that you will need to call them back, then look up their phone number in your records and call them back.
- Do not rely on Caller ID. Scammers can make it show whatever they want!
- Be really skeptical if they ask you to do something that you would not normally do. Or if they ask for personal info or usernames and passwords. Or money. Especially money.
    - This happens over the phone, via email, via regular mail and sometimes in person. It’s called “social engineering.” Beware of special requests, or if people ask you not to tell anyone else, or if the request is urgent, or if something sounds too good to be true, or if it’s anything out of the ordinary.
