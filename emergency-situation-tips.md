<h3>Be prepared.<br />
Know how to respond.</h3>

## Be prepared for the unexpected!
- Plan in advance how to survive and help others in different emergency situations.
- In extreme cases, it’s everyone for themselves! Save yourself first, then help others when it’s safe to do so.
- Tell your boss and closest coworkers if you have any life-threatening medical conditions like severe nut allergies, asthma, diabetes, heart problem, etc. Let them know how to help you in a medical emergency.
- Know where the fire extinguisher and first aid kit are located in the office.
- Know all escape paths from everywhere in the office.
- Have the cellphone numbers of your boss and their boss saved in your phone. Also store the cellphone numbers of people who report to you.
- Keep important safety items on your key-chain: mini flashlight, whistle, pepper spray, knife and/or something to gouge with.

## Workplace Violence: Move!  Escape or attack.

- **Move**: Don’t freeze in place! Move in unpredictable ways.
- **Escape**: Scatter in every direction. Run far and stay away.
    - Bring your cellphone if you can. Leave your other belongings!
    - Break your first- or second-floor office window with a desk chair or desktop computer to escape.
    - Don’t use the elevator.
    - Watch for additional threats as you make your escape.
- **Attack**: Attack the attacker with anything heavy, sharp, hot or toxic that can serve as a weapon.
- Hide only as a last resort! Block office doors with desks, hide in the ceiling, etc.
- Call 911 as soon as you can. Tell them what’s happening and where.
- When you’re safely away: Contact your boss to let them know you’re okay.
    - Don’t return to the scene of the incident until directed by your boss.
